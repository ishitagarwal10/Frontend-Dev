Question 1- Explain the difference between frontend, backend, and full-stack development with
suitable real-world examples.
Answer 1- 
Frontend development deals with everything that user can see and interact with directly, on a website
or an app. It focuses on user interface(UI) and user Experience(UX).
Techlogies we use there are-
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Example- If we think of amazon website, the images of the product, where they are displayed, how 
they are displayed, add to cart button etc.

Backend development focuses on the server side, the part which is not visible to the user. It includes
handling data and logic behind the scenes
Techlogies used-
Python, java, php, MySQL, MongoDB etc.
Example- In the same example the product we select and add to cart, is stored in the backend in the database
all the interactions we make with any webpage or website are stored there.

FullStack development works on both frontend plus backend, it means integrating both the sides, the
user side and the server side.
Technologies used-
A mix of both what we have discussed earlier
Example- The full fledge website of amazon which is working.


Question 2- Create a simple diagram showing how the client-server model works in web architecture. 
Answer 3-


Question 3- Describe how a browser requests and displays a web page from a web server.
Answer 3- When a user enters a web address (URL) into the browser, the following steps occur:
DNS Resolution:
The browser first contacts a Domain Name System (DNS) server to translate the website’s domain name
(e.g., www.google.com) into its corresponding IP address, which identifies the web server on the internet.

Establishing a Connection:
The browser then establishes a connection to the web server using HTTP or HTTPS protocol (via TCP/IP).
In case of HTTPS, an SSL/TLS handshake occurs to ensure secure communication.

Sending the Request:
The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server asking for the web page’s content (usually an HTML file).

Server Processing:
The web server receives the request, processes it, and may interact with a database or backend 
application to gather data.Then, it sends back an HTTP response, which includes the requested HTML 
file and possibly links to other resources like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

Receiving and Rendering the Page:
The browser receives the HTML file and starts rendering it:



Question 4- Identify and list the tools required to set up a web development environment. 
Explain the purpose of each.
Answer 4- Text editor to write code, browser to view it, server to host it, version control to track changes, package
manager for libraries, and database to store data.


Question 5- Explain what a web server is and give examples of commonly used servers. 
Answer 5- A web server is a software and hardware system that stores, processes, and delivers
web pages to users upon request via the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. When user’s browser requests a webpage,
the web server finds the requested file and sends it back to the browser for displaying it to the user.
It can also handle server-side scripts, manage security, and process API requests.

Examples of Commonly Used Web Servers:
Apache HTTP Server – Open-source and widely used for hosting websites.
Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services) – Used in Windows environments.
Node.js – Used to create lightweight, event-driven web servers for dynamic applications.



Question 6- Define the roles of a frontend developer, backend developer, and database administrator in a project.
Answer 6-
Frontend Developer- Designs and develops the user interface of the website. They work with HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript to ensure the site is attractive, responsive, and easy to use.
Backend Developer- Handles the server-side logic. They write code to manage data processing, user 
authentication, APIs, and communication between the database and frontend.
Database Administrator-	Manages the database systems, ensuring data integrity, security, backups, and performance 
optimization. They design database schemas and maintain data availability.

Example:
In an online shopping website:
The frontend developer builds the product pages and shopping cart interface.
The backend developer handles the logic for adding items to the cart and processing orders.
The database administrator manages the storage of product details, user accounts, and transaction data.


Question 8- Explain the difference between static and dynamic websites. Provide an example of each. 
Answer 8- A static website is one in which the content remains fixed and does not change unless manually updated 
by the developer. Each page is written in HTML and looks the same for every visitor. Static websites are simple, 
load quickly, and are mainly used for small sites such as personal portfolios, company profiles, or informational pages. 
For example, a portfolio website showing a designer’s work and contact details is a static website.

A dynamic website, on the other hand, displays content that changes based on user interactions, time, or data stored 
in a database. These websites use server-side scripting languages such as PHP, Python, or Node.js to generate pages dynamically. 
The content updates automatically according to user input or database queries. Examples of dynamic websites include Facebook and Amazon, 
where the content varies for each user based on their profile, searches, and activity.

In short, static websites are fixed and fast, while dynamic websites are interactive and database-driven.


Question 9- Research and list five web browsers. Explain how rendering engines differ between them.
Answer 9- There are several popular web browsers used to access and display web pages. 
Five commonly used ones are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Opera.

Google Chrome uses the Blink rendering engine, which is known for its speed, stability, and support for modern web standards. 
It efficiently processes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display web pages smoothly.

Mozilla Firefox uses the Gecko engine, developed by Mozilla, which is open-source and designed to 
support a wide range of web technologies while offering strong customization options.

Apple Safari runs on the WebKit engine, which focuses on performance and energy efficiency, 
especially optimized for Apple devices like macOS and iOS.

Microsoft Edge, in its latest version, also uses the Blink engine (earlier it used EdgeHTML). 
This change improved its performance and compatibility with modern web applications.

Opera also uses the Blink engine (previously it used Presto) and is known for additional features 
like a built-in VPN and data-saving mode.

In essence, a rendering engine is the component of a browser that interprets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and 
displays the web page on the screen. Different browsers use different engines, which is why the same website 
may appear or behave slightly differently across browsers.
